# agent-ex-coop-mods
This repo contains every sm64ex-coop mod I feel like making "public" here. (Nobody checks this repo anyway so if I dropped the coolest mod ever it would take like 6 months for someone to find it.)

Recently I've slightly changed the way I store zips for multi file / folder mods, if you want to access older (less polished) versions of my mods made before 8/28/22 go to [this](https://github.com/Agent-11/agent-ex-coop-mods/tree/664c7add20d88c67d371f7467b458f1b2b6ee45b) commit or any before it.

This mod adds guns to sm64ex-coop. You will automatically obtain a gun and shoot it by pressing Y. Swap between the pistol and the magnum with DPad Up.

This gamemode revolves around getting the fastest time and getting to the top of the tower the fastest, you can view the scores with /scoreboard
If you wish to play another gamemode on this map (e.g. manhunt / hide and seek) then run /ctt off on host.

## Downing

This mod adds a Left 4 Dead like incapacitation system where instead of dying you will be incapacitated and someone has to come and revive you before you die, they can also continously bash you while incapacitated until you actually die. Incapacitation doesn't work over death planes, vertical wind, quicksand or lava for obvious reasons.

## sm64js Moveset

This mod ports Mario's moveset from sm64js into sm64ex-coop. You can dive chain, ground pound jump, ground pound dive, glide and kart.

This mod adds just a simple position display on the side of your screen, works with all resolutions.

## Nametags

This mod adds nametags to sm64ex-coop, a long awaited feature of sm64ex-coop that (from what I know) will never officially get added.
