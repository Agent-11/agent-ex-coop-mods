# Breaking Bad Death Cutscene

This mod replaces the normal death sequence with the final shot of Breaking Bad where the camera pans away from Walter White's body. Bubbling is automatically disabled and the sequence is only triggered by dying standing, on your back, on your stomach, suffocating, being electrocuted or drowning.

Run /bb-gameover to toggle the death cutscene only playing if you have 0 lives left.
